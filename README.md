# ZNC Skins

This repo holds skins that I have created for [ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC).

To install the skins, you will need to place the theme folder (extracted from the .tar.gz) into the `/usr/local/share/znc/webskins/` directory. 

Note: Your install may be in a different location, so be sure to place the skin folder in the proper directory.
